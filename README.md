# VRCLaserLines
##About
This project in this repository is mainly based on an open-source Unity Asset, "Volumetric Lines Unity" by https://github.com/johannesugb/VolumetricLinesUnity,
  which is based on a set of efficient "Light Saber" and billboarded line shaders for Unity's Built-in render pipeline (BIRP).   

The main objective of this project is to progressively adapt and wrap the shaders with basic (Udon) U# modules for creating coloured laser beams, light rays, and 3D lattices in VRChat World projects.

Note: If you want to use these shaders in a standard Unity Project (Built-in render pipeline), head over to Johannes Unterguggenberger's GitHub https://github.com/johannesugb/VolumetricLinesUnity. 
A URP version is also available as a (reasonably priced) paid option in the Unity Asset store.
